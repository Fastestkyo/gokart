in the cad i have put the max number of 3d models i could find. 
this is a basic electric gokart which runs on a lifepo4 battery. it has a brushed motor. 

the rear axle is simple, i will take a steel rod and then weld the weldable hub sprocket thing to the rod. i will also weld the brake disc with some weldable hub thing too. the flange for the wheels will be welded (everything welded!). the steering system is basic its kinda like this https://www.diygokarts.com/kart-plans/steering-plan-assembly.html .
