### day 1: 30 may, 2025 (2 hours)
-made the chassis. using 1" steel pipe and welding everything together. i will be smaw welding, using my welder. the gokart chassis will be a metre long and about 600mm wide. You need (600x2 + 215x2 + 50x2 + 200x2 + 170x2 + 320 + 410 + 560 + 140x2 + 290 + 575 + 450x2)mm = 5805mm = 5.805m = ~6m of 1‚Äù pipe. this gokart chassis design is based on [this](https://grabcad.com/library/designing-a-go-kart-chassis-with-a-roll-hoop-for-safety-1). the braking system will be using a hydraulic caliper braking thing. i will be using a 1" dia 600mm long steel rod for rear axle, as rear axle is too expensive. i will be welding the sproket and all to the steel pipe.

### day 2: 31 may, 2025 (2 hours):
- done with ~most~ all of the gokart! the steering system will be made from scratch. it will be of metal flatbar and bolts. will be using m12 bolts. the idea of steering is based on [this](https://www.diygokarts.com/kart-plans/steering-plan-assembly.html). the seat will either be a cheap plastic seat (around 2500 inr which is ~30 dollars). the electroncs are fairly simple. there will be a 48v 12ah lifepo4 rechargable. im using a 1000w brushed motor. i think i may switch for a brushless one.the battery will last approximately 30 mins at 1000w. It is going to last abt 25 kms. for the wheels im going to use 11" dia and 6" wide solid rubber wheels, which are not for gokarts, but im using them anyway. ill be welding the wheels to the rear axle and the front thigneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
